# mion-docs Meeting Minutes

## Meeting 1, 2020-11-05

### Documentation process

* Follow the same process as for merging code into the other github mion repos
* as it is described in here: <https://github.com/NetworkGradeLinux/mion-docs/blob/dunfell/_meta/git_commandments.md>
* Commit messages
* New features should be documented by the person writing the code.
* Docs should be tested on locally with Jekyll - depending on the change
  * Kat to document this as part of the process
  * Should be replaced by an integration docs site (Kat to explore)
  * Linter for markdown on pull requests -
    * 100 column width maybe?
* Community contributions - Frédéric to do a test submission for review

### TODO

* Elect maintainers - Kat and Mike
* Enforce restriction on merging own code - for all repos (Mike/John to do this)
* Pull request template for the code (Mike to show John how to do this)
* Prerequisite knowledge document in the mion docs (Mike - John to send on the
  starting doc)
* Book a recurring meeting for documentation - every second week?
* Figure out the difference between the source and binary distribution - some
* users will need a fast getting start guide based on binary installer (Kat?)
