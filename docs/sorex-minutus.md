# A tale of the tinniest little pygmy shew

## Part II: And the search continues

In March, she was seen leaving Copeland, heading west.
In late June, she was spotted on Dernish Island. An analysis of our pygmy shew's
behavior indicates that she will likely be heading a short distance North,
likely towards Eighter Island. We will be sending our top engineers and
community volunteers there, in hope that we will be reunited with our mascot.

Once again, please contact us in our random channel on slack if you have spotted
her or wish to volunteer.

## Part I: The Search for our Mascot

You see, in all the commotion of preparing this release, we seem to have
misplaced our mascot, and even forgot to give her a name. If you happen to run
across an Irish Pygmy Shew that you think maybe her, please take an original
photo, drawing, or, best of all, a vector based image, and submit it to us in
our `# random` NGL Slack channel. We do hope she shows up before the next
release, she's important for project morale!
