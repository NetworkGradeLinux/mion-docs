# A tale of the tinniest little pygmy shew

## Part I: The Search for our Mascot

You see, in all the commotion of preparing this release, we seem to have
misplaced our mascot, and even forgot to give her a name. If you happen to run
across an Irish Pygmy Shew that you think maybe her, please take an original
photo, drawing, or, best of all, a vector based image, and submit it to us in
our `# random` NGL Slack channel. We do hope she shows up before the next
release, she's important for project morale!
