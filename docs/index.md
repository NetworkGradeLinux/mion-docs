# mion

mion is a bare-metal operating system for network devices, with
security and supportability at it's core.

[View it on GitHub](https://github.com/NetworkGradeLinux/mion-docs)

> Welcome to our mion documentation site. Before continuing, it's
always a good idea to check the version selector in the upper left menu.

mion provides a network operating system(NOS) focusing on enterprise level
managed switches with support for the [Open Network Install Environment(ONIE)](http://onie.org/)
and the [Open Network Linux Platform API](https://opencomputeproject.github.io/OpenNetworkLinux/onlp/).

The core function of mion is providing a secure, reliable, and performant
operating system. Designed for environments that maintain critical elements such
as Critical National Infrastructure, scalable from datacenter to telco, all done
securely.

As network devices are highly visible targets, where attacks could cause
catastrophic harm through failure, a secure software foundation with a strong
and supportive community is vital. With mion being built from the Yocto Project,
security is baked in.

The mion team values inclusiveness and diversity. This is not just a slogan for
us, it is the philosophy that underpins the team. We work hard to ensure that we
respect, value and encourage participation from every walk of life. For us,
community is core.
