# Accessibility

**Note: we are aware that this version of our documentation does not pass all**
**This is due to issues with the theme. We humbly apologize for this, and are**
**working to address this as soon as possible.**

The mion project, including this site, endeavours to be as accessible as
possible with respect to
the [World Wide Web Consortium's](https://www.w3.org/) (w3c)
[Web Accessibilty Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/) (WAI), and
[Web Content AccessibilityGuidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/),
and the needs of our community. To that end, all alterations to this
documentation is checked with the following tools until they don't provide
errors from an accessibility point of view:

* [`tota11y`](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/) browser app;
* [Google Chrome's Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse),
  running in incognito mode;
* [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool.

If you have any questions or feedback, you can join our
[community](https://docs.mion.io/latest/community/Community/) or reach out to
our [Community Lead](ben@ageofpeers.com). To ensure that contact info is up to
