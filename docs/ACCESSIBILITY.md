[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).
To that end, any alterations to the documentation must make sure that the
following tools do not provide any errors from an accessibility point of view:

* [`tota11y`](https://khan.github.io/tota11y/) browser app;
* [Google Chrome's Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse),
  running in incognito mode;
