Glossary
========

Mion/Oryx
---------
* __BitBake Recipe__: Basic metadata file that describes the building of a package. Includes descriptions, locations
* __Application Profile__: Configuration in Oryx/Mion that defines what's required to build a particular application.
Can require and therefore be composed with other application profiles.
* __System Profile__: Configuration in Oryx/Mion that defines a system for an application to be run on. This usually
describes a physical device, or a `runc` container. Is associated with a __single__ application profile.
* __`oryxcmd`__: Lightweight command line utility for managing containers in Oryx
* __`miona`__: Lightweight command line utility for managing containers in Mion. A "fork" of `oryxcmd`
