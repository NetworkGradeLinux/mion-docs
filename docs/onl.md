Open Network Linux (ONL) is an operating system for network devices with the
goal of providing a platform API capable of exposing and controlling chassis
hardware such as fans, PSUs, thermals and SFPs. The platform abstraction 
software is known as ONLP. However, it does not handle control of switch fabric,
but serves as a foundation for other operating systems and software that does. 
Operating systems that use ONL as a base, or use the platform API have included:
* Stratum
* RtBrick

Given the ubiquitous nature of ONLP, it made sense to use it as a target for 
the Mion proof of concept. -->
