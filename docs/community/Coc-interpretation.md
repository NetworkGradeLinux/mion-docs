# Interpretation of the Code of Conduct

Taking inspiration from the [Linux Kernel Contributor Code of Conduct Interpretation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/code-of-conduct-interpretation.html#code-of-conduct-interpretation),
we are providing our interpretation of the aforementioned Code of Conduct which
has been adopted for use for mion; this allows for
adaptation specific to our project.

As Network Grade Linux grows and changes over time, so may our interpretation.
Expect this document to be subject to change. Changes to our
interpretation, if and when they do occur, will be announced through the
appropriate community communication channels, and a changelog will be attached
at the end of this document.

## Standards

While the Code of Conduct provides examples of behavior that contributes to a
positive environment, we acknowledge that these are only examples, and that they
serve as a point of reference; that is, the behavior we expect in our community
goes beyond the examples.

We also believe that our standards should not only avoid being disrespectful or
harmful, but should work towards the goal of actively welcoming others into the
community. In other words, we strive to create an environment where individuals
know that they will be respected and welcomed before they joined and not only
after they have done so.

In line with our standards is our
[style-guide](https://github.com/NetworkGradeLinux/mion-docs/blob/dunfell/_meta/style_guide.md),
which we expect contributors to be familiar with, and to follow our guidelines
on Inclusivity and Supporting Diversity.

## Responsibilities

### Maintainers

#### Definition of Maintainers

When referenced in the Code of Conduct, maintainer applies to those
responsible for the approval of merging branches, acceptance of patches, and
general maintenance of any repository belonging to Network Grade Linux.

The term also extends to the individual or individuals who monitor general
communication channels such as, but not limited to any Slack channels not
specific to a given repository. This role belongs to the project team contact
or contacts provided under the Enforcement section of our Code of Conduct.

The maintainers are generally listed within each repository `README.md`.

#### Code of Conduct Responsibilities for Maintainers

Our maintainers are expected to model the Code of Conduct, and to address
unacceptable behavior. Responses to possible violations are expected to be
performed in a timely manor, while also taking the time to communicate with the
project's leaders to ensure that any actions taken are done so in a thoughtful
manor which represents our values.

## Scope

The scope extends to accounts which submit patches and pull requests, such as on
github.

## Enforcement

It is preferable that reports are submitted to the project team lead mentioned
under the Code of Conduct. That said, it is also expected that all maintainers
and project leadership will monitor the community, actively addressing
situations by discussing possible violation with leadership, rather than only
taking action when a report is made.
