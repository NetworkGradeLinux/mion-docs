This is also a good time to remind you to check that you're reading the correct documentation version. Read the release notes for full list of changes. Additional Features Trusted Platform Module Trusted Platform Module (TPM) support in mion TPM support is provided by the meta-security/meta-tpm layer. For any system with a TPM2 chip, add tpm2 to MACHINE_FEATURES in meta-mion-bsp/<vendor>/conf/machine/<machine_name>.conf to include both the required kernel drivers, and a number of user-space TPM2 tools. The kernel module is automatically loaded on boot and will create a device node (usually /dev/tpm0 ) which provides access to the hardware. Newly Added Features SDE With the introduction of our meta-mion-sde/meta-mion-barefoot layer, the necessary components for the Barefoot SDE are now available, enabling Tofino asics . For more information and on how to use it, checkout out the README Development Image Development images can now be built with packagegroup-dev-mion . This will include tools for building and debugging on the target. QEMU A qemux86-64 mion image with ONLPv1 support can now be built. The primary purpose of this qemu image is to support testing, such as p-tests and OpenEmbedded runtime tests . Outside of internal testing purposes, the qemu image can give you a quick look at mion without the need to install it on bare-metal. UEFI Secure Boot UEFI Secure Boot has been partially implemented . See the above link to our dev wiki for more info. Ends BusyBox BusyBox was removed from the default set of packages. BusyBox is a collection of unix utilities all bundled into a single package. Meant for situations where every byte counts, it is often the case that useful functionality is left out, providing tools that don't work as we may expect. For example, the BusyBox version of ln doesn't support the --relative argument. However, this isn't the issue in most mion use-cases.

We added the cake. Obtaining mion Sources If you are ready to start building mion: git clone --recursive https://github.com/NetworkGradeLinux/mion.git cd mion # To obtain related mion layers: git clone https://github.com/NetworkGradeLinux/meta-mion.git # Obtain the mion hardware layer git clone https://github.com/NetworkGradeLinux/meta-mion-bsp.git # meta-mion-sde is optional git clone https://github.com/NetworkGradeLinux/meta-mion-sde.git The main repository for mion contains sub-modules for OpenEmbedded and Yocto Project of layers which mion depends on. To properly clone them, rather than just the top directory, the --recursive argument is required. mion provides the build script (mc_build.sh) and configuration files in build/conf/ . The meta-mion layer provides mion distro configuration. Basic Usage To begin, set up the build environment using the OpenEmbedded init script: source openembedded-core/oe-init-build-env This will place you in the build directory. Afterwords you can use our build script. Running ../mc_build.sh without arguments displays basic usage. In general: ../mc_build.sh -m <machine> -c <container config>:<container image> -h <host config>:<host_image> -d container_image To do a \"dry run\" without running a build, add -e which emits what would have run if you ran this from bitbake. If you want to disable the auto-starting of the container, use -d with a comma delineated list of the container image name. If you are familiar with Yocto Project development and multiconfig and wish to use bitbake directly for builds, see the local.conf for variables that need to be set. You can also get the variables by running the mc_build.sh script with the build variables you wish to use along with the -e option and prepending the BB_ENV_EXTRAWHITE output to the bitbake command you which to use in order to pass them in on the command line. Note: The script can not always determine the vendor name, if you encounter that issue,or just want to be sure, you can use -v <VENDOR> to specify. Build Script Examples # Builds an ONLPV1 Guest, installs it on a mender updatable host and autostarts ../mc_build.sh -m stordis-bf2556x-1t -c guest:mion-guest-onlpv1 -h host-mender:mion-host # Builds just an ONLPV1 Guest. Useful for creating update artifacts. ../mc_build.sh -m stordis-bf2556x-1t -c guest:mion-guest-onlpv1 # Builds an ONLPV1 ONIE image ../mc_build.sh -m stordis-bf2556x-1t -h host-onie:mion-onie-image-onlpv1 # Builds an image with ONLPV2 and ONLPV1 guests but disables ONLPV1 guest ../mc_build.sh -m stordis-bf2556x-1t -c guest:mion-guest-onlpv1,guest:mion-guest-onlpv2 -h host-mender:mion-host -d mion-guest-onlpv1 # Emits the commandline to build an image with ONLPV2 and ONLPV1 guests but disables ONLPV1 guest ../mc_build.sh -e -m stordis-bf2556x-1t -c guest:mion-guest-onlpv1,guest:mion-guest-onlpv2 -h host-mender:mion-host -d mion-guest-onlpv1 # Builds a qemu image with ONLPV1, useful for testing purposes ../mc_build.sh -v qemu -m qemux86-64 -h host-onie:mion-image-onlpv1 Image Creation Once you've gone through the pre-requirements, have your build host set up, and looked at the build script examples, you're ready to create an image yourself. After you run the mc_build.sh script, bitbake gets called, first parsing all the recipes and making sure your local.conf and bblayers.conf looks good, before going to work \"baking\" your image! Much like a multilayer cake, how fast it gets finished is going to depend on the quantity and complexities of the layers, and how reliable your baking setup is! While you enjoy a relaxing break, keep an eye on the screen for something like this: Assuming you are still in the build directory, you'll find the finished images and related items such as the onie-installer in tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<VENDOR>-<MACHINE>/ Build Process Plan on the initial run to take some time, with following builds being much less. For a Linux VM with V Virtual CPUs and 32G RAM, a build will likely break down as follows: Fetching sources and setting up build environment : 5 minutes Building of the image : 3 hours Deploying mion via ONIE : 5 minutes per switch You're finally done with this guide? Now it's time for Installing mion ! If you've built the qemu image, from the build directory, run: runqemu may require setting up a tap interface.
