mion provides a network operating system(NOS) focusing on enterprise level
managed switches with support for the [Open Network Install Environment(ONIE)](http://onie.org/)
support and the Open Network Linux Platform (ONLP) API.

A key driver of mion is to provide an operating system designed for
operation in high-risk environments (such as Critical National Infrastructure),
and to foster an inclusive and supportive community foundation.

As network devices are a high visibility target for attacks which could cause
catastrophic harm through failure, a secure software foundation with a strong
and supportive community is vital. With mion being built from the Yocto Project,
security is baked in.
