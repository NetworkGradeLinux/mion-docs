# The Network Grade Linux Community

Welcome to Network Grade Linux/mion! Community is where open source lives and
thrives. Whether you have questions about using mion or code to contribute,
below you'll find useful information on how to participate and become a member
of our community!

First, please read and agree to our [Code of Conduct](docs/community/code-of-conduct.md).

## How to Participate

There are a number of ways to participate, from contributing code and
documentation to communicating with others in the community. 

Each repository may have different requirements for contributing, in which case
it can be found in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the repository's root. For an
overview of how to contribute, including patch guidelines and git workflow, see
[mion/CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NetworkGradeLinux/mion/blob/dunfell/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Getting in Touch

The best way to get in touch is our [Slack](networkgradelinux.slack.com), or you
can attend one of our public meetings.

### Slack

All are welcome to stop by, introduce themselves, and say hi to us over on Slack!

Here's our current slack channels, and what each are used for:

* **general:** news, announcements and project wide discussions, good place to introduce
  yourself to everyone!
* **gh-notify:** reserved for automated github updates on CI builds, issue
  statuses, and pull requests
* **network-grade-linux:** mostly technical discussions, this is where you
  should ask questions regarding mion
* **random:** this is a great place to say hi and simply hangout and chat

While not required, we suggest filling out your slack profile with what you do,
and adding where you work in parentheses in your display name. Keep in mind
  that many of us are in different time zones, so replies may take some time.

### Public Meetings

Public meetings are subject to changes, it is always best to check on our Slack
`#general` channel for updates. Meetings are done over Zoom.
