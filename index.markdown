The key driver of this project is to provide an operating system designed for 
operation in high-risk environments such as Critical National Infrastructure,
and foster an inclusive and supportive community foundation.

Network devices are a high
visibility target for attack, and could cause catastrophic harm through failure.
A secure software foundation with a strong and supportive community is
essential.
